# 1Q_FinalProject
This is the submission of my final project in CS3. It contains the files needed for the website, such as the css and the images.
The topics covered in this activity are all the topics we have learned in 1st quarter CS3, such as basic HTML coding and CSS.
It has been updated with new features like CSS link styles, tags, media, and pseudo-classes.
